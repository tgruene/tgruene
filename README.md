I am Tim Gruene and head the [Core Facility Crystal Structure Analysis](http://ccsa.univie.ac.at), 
part of the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Vienna. We determine structures of (mainly) chemical structures, and we do this
with crystallography. We use X-rays and electron radiation, and we operate on single crystals and crystalline powders.
My research interest 
is crystallography in general and electron crystallography in particular:
how to get the best out of the instrument, addressing detector development (in collaboration
with the PSI detector group), data collection strategies and data processing.

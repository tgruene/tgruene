I am Tim Gruene and head the Centre for X-ray Structure Analysis, 
part of the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Vienna. I prefer 
to call it 'Centre for Chemical Structure Analysis', because we not only
use X-rays for crystallography, but also electrons. My research interest 
is crystallography in general and electron crystallography in particular.
